#### Tools
primarily testing Django apps

* Django-nose 
* coverage.py 
* mock 

Tools to help with api testing in particular

* swagger api docs 
* mailman


#### Basics-tips

* I use nose to help me find test and generate my reports. Use coverage to see which lines of code actually run during your test. This will help you identify portions that you might have forgotten to write a test case for. Here’s what my Django settings look like 

```python
TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'

# Tell nose to measure coverage on the 'foo' and 'bar' apps
NOSE_ARGS = [
    '--cover-package=foo',
    '--cover-package=bar',
    '--cover-erase',
    '--with-coverage',
    '--cover-html',
    '--exclude-dir=project/core/randomfolder',
    '--nologcapture',
    '--verbosity=2',
]
```


* Using `reverse` is a very clean way of hitting your url/api endpoints. Just make sure you give your url a name

```python
# url.py 
url(r'^offices/(?P<office>.+)/employees/$', employee_list, name='employee_list'),

# test_app.py 
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

# hardcoding urls is prob bad idea
end_point = 'offices/ny/employees'

# a better way
end_point = reverse('employee_list', kwargs={'office': 'ny'})
```
* Get to know the django request/response cycle well https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/

```python
# You might need to modify headers to have auth tokens!
response = self.client.post(endpoint, post_data, HTTP_AUTHENTICATION='token')

# or maybe you need to have some special encoding 
import urllib
response = self.client.post(
    endpoint,
    data=urllib.urlencode(post_data),
    content_type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
)

# Don't forget the great built in json library from python to load your response!
import json
data = json.loads(response.content)
```

#### Speeding it up
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

* Use the `REUSE_DB=1` flag to 
* One way to speed up your test is to generate your fixtures in a higher up function. This stops the `TestCase` class from resetting fixtures in between test

Note though this might negatively affect other test that have IO to the database!

```python
from django.test import TestCase

def setup():
    generate_posts()
    generate_comments()

class SampleTestCase(TestCase):

    def test_post_retrival(self):
        pass

    def test_comment_retrival(self):
        pass
```
