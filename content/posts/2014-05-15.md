### Basics tips

Using `reverse` is a very clean way of hitting your url/api endpoints. Just make sure you give your url a name

```python
# url.py 
url(r'^offices/(?P<office>.+)/employees/$', employee_list, name='employee_list'),

# test_app.py 
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse

# hardcoding urls is prob bad idea
end_point = 'offices/ny/employees'

# a better way
end_point = reverse('employee_list', kwargs={'office': 'ny'})
```
Get to know the django request/response cycle well https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/

```python
# You might need to modify headers to have auth tokens!
response = self.client.post(endpoint, post_data, HTTP_AUTHENTICATION='token')

# or maybe you need to have some special encoding 
import urllib
response = self.client.post(
    endpoint,
    data=urllib.urlencode(post_data),
    content_type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
)

# don't forget the great built in json lirbary from python to load your response!
import json
data = json.loads(response.content)
```
