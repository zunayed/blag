Summary: Visualization of 2013 NBA Season


Unfortunately NBA stats APIs cost hundreds of dollars a month even for small amounts of requests. So I resorted to beautifulsoup and web scraping in my [original attempt](/posts/2014/May/20/knicks-stats/) at getting some data.

While examining the NBA site I noticed the site didn't load its data immediately and I had a hunch it was consuming some internal api. A quick look on the XHR tab in Chrome's inspect panel revealed all the api calls being made. As excited as I was discovering the endpoints I felt shitty for wasting all that time scraping html.

With the new api at hand I rewrote my scraping script to consume the apis and calculated the averages of all the games per team in the 2013 season. The next task was to get all the team stadiums to plot on a map of the US.

I was able to reuse a good chunk of javascript code from last NBA mapping project. After a good deal of tweaking of the quantize function, max radius size and colors I finally got a [working visualization](http://knicks-stats.dtostillwell.com/).

One thing I had never been able to wrap my head around was transitions with D3. It is however very easy once you realize that the transition interface works like the selection interface. Notice the similarities to the way the origional circles are created and later transitioned

```javascript
// Creating the circles
d3.csv("static/data/stadium_geo_data.csv", function(data){
        point_group.selectAll("circle")
            .data(data)
            .enter()
            .append("circle")
            .attr("cx", function(d){ return projection([d.lon, d.lat])[0]; })
            .attr("cy", function(d){ return projection([d.lon, d.lat])[1]; })
            .attr("shortname", function(d){ return d.shortname; })
            .attr("team", function(d){ return d.team; })
            .attr("r", function(d){ return radSize(d.shortname); })
            .attr("fill", function(d){ return radColor(d.shortname); })
            .on("mouseover", mouseOver)
            .on("mouseout", mouseOut)
    });
```

```javascript
// function to later change and animate them
var changeData = function() {
    point_group.selectAll("circle")
        .transition()
        .duration(750)
        .attr("r", function(d){ return radSize(d.shortname); })
        .attr("fill", function(d){ return radColor(d.shortname); })
};

```
